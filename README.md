While Cappy was mostly written from scratch, the first version of this project started life as a fork of Peter Coles'
Full Page Screen Capture plugin (https://github.com/mrcoles/full-page-screen-capture-chrome-extension). Cappy still
benefits from a number of solutions implemented in Peter's plugin, so thank you Peter (and others) for all your work!
